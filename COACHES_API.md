## Usage Examples

### Get All Coaches
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/coaches
```

### Get Specific Coach
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/coaches/COACH_ID
```

### Update Coach Prompt
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/coaches/COACH_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "coach_prompt_content": "Your new coach persona prompt here..."
  }'
```

## Integration with Custom Prompts

Coaches are linked to custom prompts through a 1-1 relationship in the database. Each custom prompt can be associated with a specific coach, but this relationship is managed internally and not exposed through the Coaches API.

## Database Schema

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE coaches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  coach_prompt_content TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  tags TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Default Data

The system automatically creates a default wellness coach on first setup:

- **Name**: "Default Wellness Coach"
- **Description**: "Primary wellness coaching persona for user interactions"
- **Tags**: ["default", "wellness", "primary"]
- **Active**: true

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message description"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing or invalid coach_prompt_content
- **404 Not Found**: Coach ID not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or server issues

## Limitations

- **No Creation**: New coaches cannot be created through the API
- **No Deletion**: Coaches cannot be deleted through the API
- **Limited Updates**: Only `coach_prompt_content` can be updated
- **No Deactivation**: Coaches cannot be deactivated through the API

These limitations ensure system stability and prevent accidental loss of coach data.
