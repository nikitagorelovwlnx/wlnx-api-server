# ‚úÖ Prompt Management System Integration Complete

## üéØ What Was Implemented

I've successfully integrated the actual prompts from the telegram bot and created the API endpoint that the bot expects.

### ‚úÖ Real Prompts from Telegram Bot
- Imported actual prompts from `/Users/nikita-gorelov-wlnx/Projects/wlnx-telegram-bot/src/prompts/`
- Translated to English and adapted for API delivery
- Maintained original conversational tone and structure

### ‚úÖ Updated Stage Structure
The system now uses the exact stage IDs that the bot expects:

1. **`demographics_baseline`** - Basic demographics and physical data
2. **`biometrics_habits`** - Sleep, activity, nutrition, stress levels
3. **`lifestyle_context`** - Work schedule, family, recovery resources
4. **`medical_history`** - Health conditions, medications, contraindications
5. **`goals_preferences`** - Health goals, activity preferences, coaching style

### ‚úÖ Bot Integration Endpoint
Created the exact endpoint the bot calls: `GET /api/prompts/wellness-stages`

## ü§ñ For Telegram Bot Integration

The bot can now retrieve prompts using:

```typescript
// Bot calls this endpoint
const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/prompts/wellness-stages`);
const { data } = await response.json();

// Response format matches what promptConfigService expects:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a wellness data analyst...",
    "stages": [
      {
        "stage": "demographics_baseline",
        "systemPrompt": "Validation prompt",
        "stagePrompt": "STAGE: DEMOGRAPHICS COLLECTION\n\nExtract demographic data...",
        "introductionMessage": "Let's get acquainted! üòä Tell me about yourself...",
        "requiredFields": ["age", "gender"],
        "completionCriteria": "Perfect! Now I have your basic info..."
      }
      // ... 4 more stages
    ]
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## üìã Updated Prompts

### Stage 1: Demographics Baseline
```
Let's get acquainted! üòä Tell me a bit about yourself - your age, where you live, and basic physical data (height, weight). This will help me understand you better.

I'm looking to learn about:
- Your age
- Gender
- Current weight (in kg) 
- Height (in cm)
- Location/city
- Time zone (if relevant)

Feel free to share whatever you're comfortable with - we can fill in details as we go!
```

### Stage 2: Biometrics and Habits
```
Excellent! Now let's talk about your habits üìä How much do you usually sleep? How about physical activity - walking, steps? What about nutrition and general well-being?

I'm interested in:
- Sleep duration (hours per night)
- Sleep quality (good, poor, average)
- Daily steps or physical activity
- Resting heart rate (if you know it)
- Stress levels (low, moderate, high)
- Nutrition habits and eating patterns
- Hydration, caffeine, alcohol intake

Share what you know - even approximate answers help!
```

### Stage 3: Lifestyle Context
```
Good! Now it's important to understand your lifestyle üè¢ Tell me about work, schedule, family matters. What affects your day and how do you recover?

I'd like to know about:
- Work schedule and type of job
- Workload and stress from work
- Business travel or irregular hours
- Night shifts or unusual schedules
- Family obligations and responsibilities
- How you recover and relax
- Cognitive demands of your work

This helps me understand what factors influence your wellness.
```

### Stage 4: Medical History
```
Let's move to an important topic - health üè• Are there any health issues, injuries, medications, or limitations? If everything is fine - just say there are no problems.

I'm asking about:
- Chronic health conditions or ongoing issues
- Past injuries that might affect activities
- Current medications or supplements
- Any restrictions or contraindications for exercise
- Health considerations I should know about

Be especially careful with medical information - only share what you're comfortable with and what's relevant.
```

### Stage 5: Goals and Preferences
```
And finally - your goals! üéØ What do you want to achieve? What activities do you enjoy? Do you prefer working out in the morning or evening? What approach works best for you?

I'm interested in:
- Your main health and fitness goals
- Preferred types of physical activities
- Whether you're more of a morning or evening person
- What coaching style works for you (strict, flexible, supportive)
- Current motivation level
- Any specific interests or hobbies
- Lifestyle factors that are important to you

This helps me understand what kind of recommendations will actually work for your life!
